MobileParties: Lords, (Bandits)
Artisans: Questfivers and influencers in towns
rumble class: Controller vibration if playing with controller instead of keyboard








Special Info:
Maybe makes sense to move DisableHeroSpawnCampaignBehaviour out of "disabled" folder in E:\Bannerlord COOP\source\GameInterface\Services\Heroes\Patches\Disable\ folder since it is not fully disabled
and partially synced.
